Today is day 4 and after the completion of first task I moved on to the second task where in short I have to add semantic segmentation in my project. So the first thing was understanding what I have to do in my second task and I found out that first I need to add semanti segmentation model to separate regions in my previous model for colourisation which needs to be reused here. Second thing was either I have to train a model or use of Pre trained semantic segmentation model so I did some research about such models and found out about these three - 
DeepLabV3+ or Mask R-CNN
The third step will be building graphically user interface which will allow user to select the regions to colorise 
Then the fourth step I think will be to apply the colour on the selected region 
and the fifth step will be to display the result in the GUI 
So overall my plan is to make this tool which has the graphical user interface and a model which can first colourise on a grayscal image and then according to the selection done by the user it will colourise the specific regions only. 
So I have started making the project and I have decided to use a pre -trained model and then a major challenge in front of me is to integrate my previous colour risation project with this one 
 also after doing some research and having basic knowledge of the projects that have made in past I have decided to use streamlit which is easy. 
I watched few youtube videos about those pretrained models to learn about them so that on day 5 I can start the project-
