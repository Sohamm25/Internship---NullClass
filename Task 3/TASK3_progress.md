Today is day 10, I started Task 3: Conditional Image Colorization, where the goal is to allow users to colorize grayscale images based on specific conditions like making the sky blue or the grass green. 
Since user interaction is key, I decided to use a segmentation-based approach where users can select regions and assign colors, 
 After some research on methods like DeOldify, ChromaGAN, and Conditional Image Colorization (CIC), I finalized a plan to implement a Streamlit-based GUI. So far, I have set up the interface where users can upload a grayscale image, select specific regions, and assign colors, and I have also implemented a basic masking system to handle these selections. 
The UI is working fine, but tomorrow, I will focus on fine-tuning the colorization process, improving the blending of applied colors, 
 and testing the model with multiple images to ensure smooth performance.
